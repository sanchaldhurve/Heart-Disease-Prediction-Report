**HEART DISEASE PREDICTION REPORT** 

Led a complete data science pipeline in R for heart disease prediction. Conducted extensive data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing, including feature transformation and normalization. Applied clustering (K-Means, optimal k=2) to reveal patient patterns and segmentation. 
Developed and evaluated classification models using Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Achieved high predictive performance with an AUC of 0.91 and accuracy of 84.4%. Models were tuned via cross-validation and grid search to optimize hyperparameters. Visualized feature distributions, model outputs, and ROC curves for interpretability.
